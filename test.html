<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What">What is PTO (paid time off)?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.aihr.com/hr-glossary/paid-time-off/">Paid time off</a> is a policy or system that allows
    employees to take time away from work for various reasons while still receiving their regular pay. This includes
    various types of leave, such as vacation days, sick days, bereavement, and parental leave. The paid time off (PTO)
    policy helps to provide a set of guidelines and rules outlining the terms and conditions for employees to take time
    off.&nbsp;
<p>In the US, the average paid time off is 15 days annually. However, there is no federal law requiring employers to
    provide paid time off.
<p>Europe adopts a more <a href="https://www.worldpolicycenter.org/policies/is-paid-annual-leave-available-to-workers"
                           target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generous approach</a>, with France and Spain
    mandating at least 30 days, while the UK offers 28. Nordic countries like Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland all
    allocate 25 days.
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Types">Types of PTO policies</h2>
<p>Crafting a comprehensive PTO policy can be a balancing act for HR professionals, as it involves aligning
    organizational needs with employee well-being. Laws may regulate some PTO types, while others are at the discretion
    of the company.&nbsp;Here are the various <a href="https://www.aihr.com/blog/types-of-leave/">types of leave</a>:

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Include">What to include when creating a PTO policy</h2>
<p>Below is your blueprint to build a paid time off policy:
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-align-policy-to-company-culture-and-values">1. Align policy to company culture and
    values</h3>
<p>Tailor your PTO to reflect core company values. For a company championing mental health, consider adding wellness
    days. This could be a design agency emphasizing creativity sets quarterly &#8220;Inspiration Days&#8221; where
    employees explore new art forms, attend workshops, or have a learning and development day.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-ensure-equity-and-fairness-of-the-policy">2. Ensure equity and fairness of the
    policy</h3>
<p>Your PTO policy should cater to diverse needs, ensuring inclusivity. For example, a business might offer the same or
    more extended paternity and maternity leave durations.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-decide-on-the-pto-amount">3. Decide on the PTO amount</h3>
<p>Base this decision on industry benchmarks and your company&#8217;s capacity to accommodate leaves. For example, in
    the competitive tech industry, if the standard is 15 days, make a bold move with 22 days to attract top talent.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-determine-the-accrual-rate">4. Determine the accrual rate</h3>
<p>Determine the frequency with which employees accumulate PTO. For a company wanting to reward longevity, employees
    might accrue 1 extra day of PTO for every year of employment.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-define-usage-and-carry-over-expiry-rules">5. Define usage and carry-over/expiry
    rules</h3>
<p>Decide on what happens in the case of unutilized PTO. Regulations may mandate this, depending on your country. For
    many countries, paid time off must be used within a certain timeframe after the year they were accrued (such as
    within 6 months) or will be forfeited.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-include-policies-around-holidays">6. Include policies around holidays</h3>
<p>Differentiate national holidays and company-specific breaks. For instance, a global company might offer floating
    holidays, allowing employees to pick days relevant to their culture or religion and swap out national holidays for
    these.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-set-up-the-approval-process">7. Set up the approval process</h3>
<p>Set clear guidelines for PTO requests. HR software can come in handy here to help streamline requests and approvals
    by line managers while also enabling HR to track and monitor leave across the organization.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-using-an-hr-management-system-to-manage-leave">8. Using an HR management system to
    manage leave</h3>
<p>Opt for software that aligns with the size and nature of your workforce. Tools like Zoho People might be more
    appropriate for a small startup than comprehensive systems such as SAP SuccessFactors or HiBob.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-train-employees-and-managers-on-requesting-leave">9. Train employees and managers
    on requesting leave</h3>
<p>Establish regular training sessions for both new and old policies. For instance, organizations undergoing digital
    transformation can conduct bi-monthly sessions on utilizing the new digital leave request portal.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-specify-payment-on-termination-of-employment">10. Specify payment on termination
    of employment</h3>
<p>Specify the compensation employees can expect for untapped PTO (if applicable in your country). For example, in a
    high-turnover industry like hospitality, offering 75% payment for unused PTO days might reduce abrupt resignations.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Laws-and-regulations">PTO policy laws and regulations: What HR must know&nbsp;</h2>
<p>It’s imperative for HR to stay on top of PTO laws and regulations, as a lack of <a
        href="https://www.aihr.com/blog/hr-compliance/">compliance</a> can be costly for the business. Here are some US
    laws to be well-versed on:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Federal laws &#8211; </strong>At the federal level, there isn’t a blanket requirement for paid vacation
        days in the US. However, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for
        certain purposes, like childbirth or specific medical conditions.
    </li>
    <li><strong>State laws</strong> &#8211; Here, the details are more pronounced. While the federal stance might be
        lenient, states can each have their own distinct rules. For instance, the “Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families
        Act” in California gives eligible employees the right to earn paid sick leave. When crafting your PTO policy, it&#8217;s
        important to consider the state laws that will apply to your organization.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Examples">3 PTO company examples</h2>
<p>Why not learn from the leaders when you&#8217;re looking to craft a gold-standard PTO policy? These top companies
    have set impressive benchmarks, blending compassion with compliance. Let&#8217;s unpack some of these standout
    policies:
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-netflix">Netflix</h3>
<p>Known for its revolutionary <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;take
    as you need&#8221; policy</a>, Netflix focuses on performance over hours clocked in. Such a policy might be hard to
    monitor but can boost employee trust and autonomy.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hubspot"><strong>HubSpot</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to a company-wide week off in July, HubSpot has adopted an <a
        href="https://www.hubspot.com/careers/benefits#:~:text=Unlimited%20Vacation%20%26%20Global%20Week%20of%20Rest&amp;text=You%20decide%20when%20and%20for,it%27s%20truly%20unlimited%20for%20all."
        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlimited vacation policy.</a> Employees are entrusted to decide the
    duration and timing of their vacations, be it for tropical getaways or just flexible day-to-day breaks. Their
    Vacation Quota Relief (VQR) ensures that this unlimited offer is genuinely inclusive for everyone.
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ibm">IBM</h3>
<p>A leader in both tech innovation and employee welfare, IBM ensures its workforce is rejuvenated with well-structured
    time off. They recognize twelve paid U.S. holidays annually, inclusive of eight fixed days, such as New Year’s Day
    and Thanksgiving. Additionally, employees are granted four personal choice holidays to observe as they deem fit.&nbsp;
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mistakes">Common PTO policy mistakes to avoid</h2>
<p>Creating and managing a Paid Time Off (PTO) policy can be a complex task for HR departments, with potentially
    significant consequences for employees and the organization. Here are some common mistakes that HR departments may
    make when designing a PTO policy:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inadequate communication</strong> &#8211; Failing to clearly communicate the PTO policy to employees can
        lead to misunderstandings and frustration. HR should ensure all employees understand the policy, including
        accrual rates, usage guidelines, and the request/approval process.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Unclear eligibility criteria &#8211; </strong>Not clearly defining who is eligible for PTO can result in
        confusion and disputes. HR should outline eligibility criteria based on factors such as length of service,
        employment status (full-time, part-time), and any waiting periods.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Inflexible policies &#8211; </strong>Creating overly rigid policies that don&#8217;t account for
        individual circumstances can be problematic. HR should be open to considering exceptions or accommodations when
        necessary, such as allowing employees to use PTO in half-day increments.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Lack of clarity on carryover and payout</strong> &#8211; If the policy is unclear about whether unused
        PTO can be carried over to the next year or if there&#8217;s a payout option upon termination, employees may
        have unrealistic expectations, leading to disputes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Failure to track accrual properly &#8211; </strong>Not maintaining accurate records of accrued and used
        PTO can lead to discrepancies and disputes. HR should have systems in place to accurately track PTO accrual and
        usage.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring cultural and industry differences</strong> &#8211; PTO policies should consider the
        organization&#8217;s culture and industry norms. Merely copying policies from other organizations without taking
        these factors into account can result in policies that don&#8217;t align with the company&#8217;s values or
        industry requirements.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Not offering enough PTO &#8211;</strong>Providing inadequate PTO can contribute to employee burnout,
        reduced morale, and higher turnover. HR should regularly evaluate whether the organization&#8217;s PTO offerings
        are competitive and sufficient.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Key takeaway</h3>
<p>Paid time off policies are strategic tools for businesses that foster a work environment where employees feel valued,
    leading to better business outcomes that consider company values, the nature of work, industry standards, and
    employee needs.
